The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`.

For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The view states\n *\n * A View is determined by three states: `center`, `resolution`,\n * and `rotation`. Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * The `zoom` state is actually not saved on the view: all computations\n * internally use the `resolution` state. Still, the `setZoom` and `getZoom`\n * methods are available, as well as `getResolutionForZoom` and\n * `getZoomForResolution` to switch from one system to the other.\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view, but any constraint defined in the constructor will\n * be applied along the way.\n *\n * A View object can have a *resolution constraint*, a *rotation constraint*\n * and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* typically restricts min/max values and\n * snaps to specific resolutions. It is determined by the following\n * options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`, `maxZoom` and `zoomFactor`.\n * If `resolutions` is set, the other three options are ignored. See\n * documentation for each option for more information. By default, the view\n * only has a min/max restriction and allow intermediary zoom levels when\n * pinch-zooming for example.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default rotation is allowed and its value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the view center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * ### Changing the view state\n *\n * It is important to note that `setZoom`, `setResolution`, `setCenter` and\n * `setRotation` are subject to the above mentioned constraints. As such, it\n * may sometimes not be possible to know in advance the resulting state of the\n * View. For example, calling `setResolution(10)` does not guarantee that\n * `getResolution()` will return `10`.\n *\n * A consequence of this is that, when applying a delta on the view state, one\n * should use `adjustCenter`, `adjustRotation`, `adjustZoom` and `adjustResolution`\n * rather than the corresponding setters. This will let view do its internal\n * computations. Besides, the `adjust*` methods also take an `opt_anchor`\n * argument which allows specifying an origin for the transformation.\n *\n * ### Interacting with the view\n *\n * View constraints are usually only applied when the view is *at rest*, meaning that\n * no interaction or animation is ongoing. As such, if the user puts the view in a\n * state that is not equivalent to a constrained one (e.g. rotating the view when\n * the snap angle is 0), an animation will be triggered at the interaction end to\n * put back the view to a stable state;\n *\n * @api\n */\nvar View = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(View, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n     */\n    function View(opt_options) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        var options = assign({}, opt_options);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<number>}\n         */\n        _this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<Array<Animation>>}\n         */\n        _this.animations_ = [];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.updateAnimationKey_;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @const\n         * @type {import(\"./proj/Projection.js\").default}\n         */\n        _this.projection_ = createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {import(\"./coordinate.js\").Coordinate|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.targetCenter_ = null;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.targetResolution_;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.targetRotation_;\n        if (options.center) {\n            options.center = fromUserCoordinate(options.center, _this.projection_);\n        }\n        if (options.extent) {\n            options.extent = fromUserExtent(options.extent, _this.projection_);\n        }\n        _this.applyOptions_(options);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Set up the view with the given options.\n     * @param {ViewOptions} options View options.\n     */\n    View.prototype.applyOptions_ = function (options) {\n        /**\n         * @type {Object<string, *>}\n         */\n        var properties = {};\n        var resolutionConstraintInfo = createResolutionConstraint(options);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<number>|undefined}\n         */\n        this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n        var centerConstraint = createCenterConstraint(options);\n        var resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n        var rotationConstraint = createRotationConstraint(options);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Constraints}\n         */\n        this.constraints_ = {\n            center: centerConstraint,\n            resolution: resolutionConstraint,\n            rotation: rotationConstraint\n        };\n        this.setRotation(options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0);\n        this.setCenterInternal(options.center !== undefined ? options.center : null);\n        if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n            this.setResolution(options.resolution);\n        }\n        else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n            this.setZoom(options.zoom);\n        }\n        this.resolveConstraints(0);\n        this.setProperties(properties);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {ViewOptions}\n         */\n        this.options_ = options;\n    };\n    /**\n     * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.

There are two types of shaders:\n *\n *   Vertex shaders are used to manipulate the position and attribute of *vertices* of rendered primitives (ie. corners of a square).\n *   Outputs are:\n *\n *   * `gl_Position`: position of the vertex in screen space\n *\n *   * Varyings usually prefixed with `v_` are passed on to the fragment shader\n *\n *   Fragment shaders are used to control the actual color of the pixels drawn on screen. Their only output is `gl_FragColor`.\n *\n *   Both shaders can take *uniforms* or *attributes* as input. Attributes are explained later. Uniforms are common, read-only values that\n *   can be changed at every frame and can be of type float, arrays of float or images.\n *\n *   Shaders must be compiled and assembled into a program like so:\n *   ```js\n *   // here we simply create two shaders and assemble them in a program which is then used\n *   // for subsequent rendering calls\n *   const vertexShader = new WebGLVertex(VERTEX_SHADER);\n *   const fragmentShader = new WebGLFragment(FRAGMENT_SHADER);\n *   const program = this.context.getProgram(fragmentShader, vertexShader);\n *   helper.useProgram(this.program);\n *   ```\n *\n *   Uniforms are defined using the `uniforms` option and can either be explicit values or callbacks taking the frame state as argument.\n *   You can also change their value along the way like so:\n *   ```js\n *   helper.setUniformFloatValue('u_value', valueAsNumber);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Defining post processing passes\n *\n *   *Post processing* describes the act of rendering primitives to a texture, and then rendering this texture to the final canvas\n *   while applying special effects in screen space.\n *   Typical uses are: blurring, color manipulation, depth of field, filtering...\n *\n *   The `WebGLHelper` class offers the possibility to define post processes at creation time using the `postProcesses` option.\n *   A post process step accepts the following options:\n *\n *   * `fragmentShader` and `vertexShader`: text literals in GLSL language that will be compiled and used in the post processing step.\n *   * `uniforms`: uniforms can be defined for the post processing steps just like for the main render.\n *   * `scaleRatio`: allows using an intermediate texture smaller or higher than the final canvas in the post processing step.\n *     This is typically used in blur steps to reduce the performance overhead by using an already downsampled texture as input.\n *\n *   The {@link module:ol/webgl/PostProcessingPass~WebGLPostProcessingPass} class is used internally, refer to its documentation for more info.\n *\n * ### Binding WebGL buffers and flushing data into them\n *\n *   Data that must be passed to the GPU has to be transferred using {@link module:ol/webgl/Buffer~WebGLArrayBuffer} objects.\n *   A buffer has to be created only once, but must be bound every time the buffer content will be used for rendering.\n *   This is done using {@link bindBuffer}.\n *   When the buffer's array content has changed, the new data has to be flushed to the GPU memory; this is done using\n *   {@link flushBufferData}. Note: this operation is expensive and should be done as infrequently as possible.\n *\n *   When binding an array buffer, a `target` parameter must be given: it should be either {@link module:ol/webgl.ARRAY_BUFFER}\n *   (if the buffer contains vertices data) or {@link module:ol/webgl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER} (if the buffer contains indices data).\n *\n *   Examples below:\n *   ```js\n *   // at initialization phase\n *   const verticesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *   const indicesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *\n *   // when array values have changed\n *   helper.flushBufferData(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   helper.flushBufferData(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *\n *   // at rendering phase\n *   helper.bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   helper.bindBuffer(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Specifying attributes\n *\n *   The GPU only receives the data as arrays of numbers. These numbers must be handled differently depending on what it describes (position, texture coordinate...).\n *   Attributes are used to specify these uses. Use {@link enableAttributeArray_} and either\n *   the default attribute names in {@link module:ol/webgl/Helper.DefaultAttrib} or custom ones.\n *\n *   Please note that you will have to specify the type and offset of the attributes in the data array. You can refer to the documentation of [WebGLRenderingContext.vertexAttribPointer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/vertexAttribPointer) for more explanation.\n *   ```js\n *   // here we indicate that the data array has the following structure:\n *   // [posX, posY, offsetX, offsetY, texCoordU, texCoordV, posX, posY, ...]\n *   helper.enableAttributes([\n *     {\n *        name: 'a_position',\n *        size: 2\n *     },\n *     {\n *       name: 'a_offset',\n *       size: 2\n *     },\n *     {\n *       name: 'a_texCoord',\n *       size: 2\n *     }\n *   ])\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Rendering primitives\n *\n *   Once all the steps above have been achieved, rendering primitives to the screen is done using {@link prepareDraw}, {@link drawElements} and {@link finalizeDraw}.\n *   ```js\n *   // frame preparation step\n *   helper.prepareDraw(frameState);\n *\n *   // call this for every data array that has to be rendered on screen\n *   helper.drawElements(0, this.indicesBuffer.getArray().length);\n *\n *   // finalize the rendering by applying post processes\n *   helper.finalizeDraw(frameState);\n *   ```\n *\n * For an example usage of this class, refer to {@link module:ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer~WebGLPointsLayerRenderer}.\n *\n *\n * @api\n */\nvar WebGLHelper = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(WebGLHelper, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {Options=} opt_options Options.\n     */\n    function WebGLHelper(opt_options) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        var options = opt_options || {};\n        /** @private */\n        _this.boundHandleWebGLContextLost_ = _this.handleWebGLContextLost.bind(_this);\n        /** @private */\n        _this.boundHandleWebGLContextRestored_ = _this.handleWebGLContextRestored.bind(_this);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {HTMLCanvasElement}\n         */\n        _this.canvas_ = document.createElement('canvas');\n        _this.canvas_.style.position = 'absolute';\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {WebGLRenderingContext}\n         */\n        _this.gl_ = getContext(_this.canvas_);\n        var gl = _this.getGL();\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {!Object<string, BufferCacheEntry>}\n         */\n        _this.bufferCache_ = {};\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {!Array<WebGLShader>}\n         */\n        _this.shaderCache_ = [];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {!Array<WebGLProgram>}\n         */\n        _this.programCache_ = [];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {WebGLProgram}\n         */\n        _this.currentProgram_ = null;\n        assert(includes(getSupportedExtensions(), 'OES_element_index_uint'), 63);\n        gl.getExtension('OES_element_index_uint');\n        _this.canvas_.addEventListener(ContextEventType.LOST, _this.boundHandleWebGLContextLost_);\n        _this.canvas_.addEventListener(ContextEventType.RESTORED, _this.boundHandleWebGLContextRestored_);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n         */\n        _this.offsetRotateMatrix_ = createTransform();\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n         */\n        _this.offsetScaleMatrix_ = createTransform();\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<number>}\n         */\n        _this.tmpMat4_ = create();\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Object.<string, WebGLUniformLocation>}\n         */\n        _this.uniformLocations_ = {};\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Object.<string, number>}\n         */\n        _this.attribLocations_ = {};\n        /**\n         * Holds info about custom uniforms used in the post processing pass.\n         * If the uniform is a texture, the WebGL Texture object will be stored here.\n         * @type {Array<UniformInternalDescription>}\n         * @private\n         */\n        _this.uniforms_ = [];\n        if (options.uniforms) {\n            for (var name_1 in options.uniforms) {\n                _this.uniforms_.push({\n                    name: name_1,\n                    value: options.uniforms[name_1]\n                });\n            }\n        }\n        /**\n         * An array of PostProcessingPass objects is kept in this variable, built from the steps provided in the\n         * options.

For example, if the tile service advertizes 256px by 256px tiles but actually sends 512px by 512px images (for retina/hidpi devices) then `tilePixelRatio` should be set to `2`\n * @property {number} [reprojectionErrorThreshold=0.5] Maximum allowed reprojection error (in pixels).\n * Higher values can increase reprojection performance, but decrease precision.\n * @property {string} [url] URL template or base URL of the Zoomify service.\n * A base URL is the fixed part\n * of the URL, excluding the tile group, z, x, and y folder structure, e.g.\n * `http://my.zoomify.info/IMAGE.TIF/`. A URL template must include\n * `{TileGroup}`, `{x}`, `{y}`, and `{z}` placeholders, e.g.\n * `http://my.zoomify.info/IMAGE.TIF/{TileGroup}/{z}-{x}-{y}.jpg`.\n * Internet Imaging Protocol (IIP) with JTL extension can be also used with\n * `{tileIndex}` and `{z}` placeholders, e.g.\n * `http://my.zoomify.info?FIF=IMAGE.TIF&JTL={z},{tileIndex}`.\n * A `{?-?}` template pattern, for example `subdomain{a-f}.domain.com`, may be\n * used instead of defining each one separately in the `urls` option.\n * @property {string} [tierSizeCalculation] Tier size calculation method: `default` or `truncated`.\n * @property {import(\"../size.js\").Size} [size] Size of the image.\n * @property {import(\"../extent.js\").Extent} [extent] Extent for the TileGrid that is created.\n * Default sets the TileGrid in the\n * fourth quadrant, meaning extent is `[0, -height, width, 0]`. To change the\n * extent to the first quadrant (the default for OpenLayers 2) set the extent\n * as `[0, 0, width, height]`.\n * @property {number} [transition] Duration of the opacity transition for rendering.\n * To disable the opacity transition, pass `transition: 0`.\n * @property {number} [tileSize=256] Tile size. Same tile size is used for all zoom levels.\n * @property {number} [zDirection=0] Indicate which resolution should be used\n * by a renderer if the view resolution does not match any resolution of the tile source.\n * If 0, the nearest resolution will be used. If 1, the nearest lower resolution\n * will be used. If -1, the nearest higher resolution will be used.\n */\n/**\n * @classdesc\n * Layer source for tile data in Zoomify format (both Zoomify and Internet\n * Imaging Protocol are supported).\n * @api\n */\nvar Zoomify = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(Zoomify, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {Options=} opt_options Options.\n     */\n    function Zoomify(opt_options) {\n        var _this = this;\n        var options = opt_options || {};\n        var size = options.size;\n        var tierSizeCalculation = options.tierSizeCalculation !== undefined ?\n            options.tierSizeCalculation :\n            TierSizeCalculation.DEFAULT;\n        var imageWidth = size[0];\n        var imageHeight = size[1];\n        var extent = options.extent || [0, -size[1], size[0], 0];\n        var tierSizeInTiles = [];\n        var tileSize = options.tileSize || DEFAULT_TILE_SIZE;\n        var tilePixelRatio = options.tilePixelRatio || 1;\n        var tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation = tileSize;\n        switch (tierSizeCalculation) {\n            case TierSizeCalculation.DEFAULT:\n                while (imageWidth > tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation || imageHeight > tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation) {\n                    tierSizeInTiles.push([\n                        Math.ceil(imageWidth / tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation),\n                        Math.ceil(imageHeight / tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation)\n                    ]);\n                    tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation += tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation;\n                }\n                break;\n            case TierSizeCalculation.TRUNCATED:\n                var width = imageWidth;\n                var height = imageHeight;\n                while (width > tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation || height > tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation) {\n                    tierSizeInTiles.push([\n                        Math.ceil(width / tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation),\n                        Math.ceil(height / tileSizeForTierSizeCalculation)\n                    ]);\n                    width >>= 1;\n                    height >>= 1;\n                }\n                break;\n            default:\n                assert(false, 53); // Unknown `tierSizeCalculation` configured\n                break;\n        }\n        tierSizeInTiles.push([1, 1]);\n        tierSizeInTiles.reverse();\n        var resolutions = [1];\n        var tileCountUpToTier = [0];\n        for (var i = 1, ii = tierSizeInTiles.length; i < ii; i++) {\n            resolutions.push(1 << i);\n            tileCountUpToTier.push(tierSizeInTiles[i - 1][0] * tierSizeInTiles[i - 1][1] +\n                tileCountUpToTier[i - 1]);\n        }\n        resolutions.reverse();\n        var tileGrid = new TileGrid({\n            tileSize: tileSize,\n            extent: extent,\n            origin: getTopLeft(extent),\n            resolutions: resolutions\n        });\n        var url = options.url;\n        if (url && url.indexOf('{TileGroup}') == -1 && url.indexOf('{tileIndex}') == -1) {\n            url += '{TileGroup}/{z}-{x}-{y}.jpg';\n        }\n        var urls = expandUrl(url);\n        /**\n         * @param {string} template Template.\n         * @return {import(\"../Tile.js\").UrlFunction} Tile URL function.\n         */\n        function createFromTemplate(template) {\n            return (\n            /**\n             * @param {import(\"../tilecoord.js\").TileCoord} tileCoord Tile Coordinate.\n             * @param {number} pixelRatio Pixel ratio.\n             * @param {import(\"../proj/Projection.js\").default} projection Projection.\n             * @return {string|undefined} Tile URL.\n             */\n            function (tileCoord, pixelRatio, projection) {\n                if (!tileCoord) {\n                    return undefined;\n                }\n                else {\n                    var tileCoordZ = tileCoord[0];\n                    var tileCoordX = tileCoord[1];\n                    var tileCoordY = tileCoord[2];\n                    var tileIndex = tileCoordX +\n                        tileCoordY * tierSizeInTiles[tileCoordZ][0];\n                    var tileSize_1 = tileGrid.getTileSize(tileCoordZ);\n                    var tileWidth = Array.isArray(tileSize_1) ?

Great performance, but point symbols and texts\n *    are always rotated with the view and pixels are scaled during zoom animations. When `declutter`\n *    is set to `true`, the decluttering is done per tile resulting in labels and point symbols getting\n *    cut off at tile boundaries.\n *  * `'hybrid'`: Polygon and line elements are rendered as images, so pixels are scaled during zoom\n *    animations. Point symbols and texts are accurately rendered as vectors and can stay upright on\n *    rotated views.\n *\n * @property {import(\"../source/VectorTile.js\").default} [source] Source.\n * @property {import(\"../PluggableMap.js\").default} [map] Sets the layer as overlay on a map. The map will not manage\n * this layer in its layers collection, and the layer will be rendered on top. This is useful for\n * temporary layers. The standard way to add a layer to a map and have it managed by the map is to\n * use {@link module:ol/Map#addLayer}.\n * @property {boolean} [declutter=false] Declutter images and text. Decluttering is applied to all\n * image and text styles of all Vector and VectorTile layers that have set this to `true`. The priority\n * is defined by the z-index of the layer, the `zIndex` of the style and the render order of features.\n * Higher z-index means higher priority. Within the same z-index, a feature rendered before another has\n * higher priority.\n * @property {import(\"../style/Style.js\").StyleLike} [style] Layer style. See\n * {@link module:ol/style} for default style which will be used if this is not defined.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileAnimating=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will be\n * recreated during animations. This means that no vectors will be shown clipped, but the setting\n * will have a performance impact for large amounts of vector data. When set to `false`, batches\n * will be recreated when no animation is active.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileInteracting=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will be\n * recreated during interactions. See also `updateWhileAnimating`.\n * @property {number} [preload=0] Preload.
